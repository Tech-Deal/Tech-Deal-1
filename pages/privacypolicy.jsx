                            the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal
                            Information through the Website and Services. We
                            encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor
                            their children´s Internet usage and to help enforce
                            this Policy by instructing their children never to
                            provide Personal Information through the Website and
                            Services without their permission. If you have
                            reason to believe that a child under the age of 18
                            has provided Personal Information to us through the
                            Website and Services, please contact us. You must

                            <h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>
                            Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature
                            that signals to websites you visit that you do not
                            want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking
                            is not the same as using or collecting information
                            in connection with a website. For these purposes,
                            tracking refers to collecting personally
                            identifiable information from consumers who use or
                            visit a website or online service as they move
                            across different websites over time. How browsers
                            communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet
                            uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are
                            not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not
                            Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so,
                            as described in more detail throughout this Policy,
                            we limit our use and collection of your personal
                            information.
